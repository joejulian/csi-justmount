# Justmount CSI Driver

The **Justmount CSI Driver** is a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver designed to provide basic storage management functionality to Kubernetes. This driver includes both Node and Controller services and supports essential CSI operations, such as mounting, unmounting, and basic volume lifecycle management.

## Features

- **Node Service**: Manages node-local operations, including mounting and unmounting volumes.
- **Controller Service**: Supports cluster-wide operations for volume creation, deletion, and attachment.
- **CSI Compliance**: Compatible with Kubernetes and other orchestrators that support CSI.
- **Sanity Testing**: Includes `csi-sanity` tests to validate CSI functionality and compliance.

## Prerequisites

- **Kubernetes** (>= 1.13) with CSI enabled
- **Go** (>= 1.16) for building and testing the driver
- **csi-sanity** for validating CSI compliance

## Installation

### Building the Driver

To build the Justmount CSI Driver, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/justmount.git
cd justmount
go build -o bin/justmount main.go
```

This command will compile the driver binary as `bin/justmount`.

### Configuration

Justmount supports configuration through command-line flags:

- `--controller-endpoint`: Path to the Controller service socket (default: `/tmp/csi-controller.sock`)
- `--node-endpoint`: Path to the Node service socket (default: `/tmp/csi-node.sock`)
- `--node-id`: Unique identifier for each node (required for the Node service)

### Deploying on Kubernetes

1. **Install the CSI Driver**:
   Deploy the driver using appropriate Kubernetes resources (e.g., DaemonSets and Deployments) for the Controller and Node services. 

2. **Configure Storage Classes**:
   Set up a `StorageClass` that references the Justmount CSI driver:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
   kind: StorageClass
   metadata:
     name: justmount-sc
   provisioner: justmount.csi.driver
   ```

## Usage

After deploying, you can create PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) that use the configured StorageClass. Justmount will automatically handle volume provisioning, attachment, mounting, and unmounting.

### Example PVC

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: justmount-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: justmount-sc
```

## Testing

To validate the driverâ€™s functionality and compliance, run the following command:

```bash
ginkgo ./...
```

This command will execute the `csi-sanity` tests configured in `sanity_test.go` as well as any other unit tests.

## Development

### Running Locally

1. **Build the driver**:

   ```bash
   go build -o bin/justmount main.go
   ```

2. **Run the driver locally**:
   Start the driver with both Controller and Node services:

   ```bash
   ./bin/justmount --controller-endpoint /tmp/csi-controller.sock --node-endpoint /tmp/csi-node.sock --node-id <node-id>
   ```

### Running Unit Tests

Run unit tests using:

```bash
go test ./pkg/...
```

### Directory Structure

- `main.go`: Main entry point for the driver.
- `pkg/controller`: Contains Controller service code.
- `pkg/node`: Contains Node service code.
- `sanity_test.go`: Test configuration for `csi-sanity`.
